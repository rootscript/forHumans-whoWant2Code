This ~~is~~ was intended to be the start of a series of articles for medium.com called forHumans() => {whoWant2Code}.  Currently it is a Work in Progress and a collation of examples, that includes code for Elm 0.17.1 ( however Elm 0.18 is expected in the near future )

A project that helps ordinary people who want to create/code their own applications

~~//TODO:: list articles that are on medium~~

~~//TODO:: list planned articles for the forHumans 'platform'~~

//TODO:: Electron app showcasing Elm 0.18 examples ( add .class(es) to expand levels of comments detail in code examples, to tailor for people of mixed abilities ) - I like this idea

//TODO:: Electron app to search Elm documentation website(s) & various other places - I like this too
