This is a draft of an article `-elm-forHumans` for the medium.com series called `forHumans() => {whoWant2Code}`

The main project aim is to help ordinary people who want to create/code their own applications that use web technologies, to create their own native applications & not just 'traditional' web pages.

The second project aim is to encourage people who are learning Elm, to contribute back to the project, and provide them the means & structure to do that.

The Electron framework	is a key part of what I think is a very nice platform for learning, that is current & will produce useable applications.  I've been looking at the other key parts, and believe that Functional Programming & Reactive techniques are the next step in making great useable desktop apps, that leverage all the advances in web technology.

###Why use Elm?

This particular article is about the Elm language, currently at version 0.17.

Elm is everything that I want to learn, here's why:

- A Functional language as opposed to Imperative or Object Orientated styles.
- It is a Reactive language that uses a virtual DOM to apply changes to the view in a very efficient manner.
- It also uses immutable data structures, aka persistent data structures.

The marriage of these three things (in one place) is what makes Elm very attractive to learn, rather than waiting for the Functional coding style become easier in the Javascript language (ES6 arrow functions etc.. & ES7 with observables), or having to learn a bolt on framework or library to achieve the Reactive Observables (React, RxJS, Cycle.js etc...) & lastly trying to implement immutable data structures (Immutable.js & Mori JS).

Elm seems to be great, but without a growing user base, it is just a nice language used by a few guys, whose great ideas may trickle into the mainstream at some point, or it may remain a nice language used by just a few clever guys.

There is a benefit to new wanna be Elm coders & the Elm language itself to remove the high barriers to entry.  This is kind of represented in the present, where people who 'know how to code' make suggestions to people who 'want to do something specific'; commonly we often see 'read the documentation', or 'search for answers before asking questions' etc... The trouble is that usually the googled solution, the StackOverflow answer, or the library's documentation are only able to be understood by people who already know how to code.

The best approaches I've seen is where someone teaching assumes that you know nothing, and is willing to provide multiple examples & solutions to small problems, but grow those small solutions by taking things a stage further, and combining them into something bigger, and something that someone really might want to do, rather than present another ToDo app, or mention the word 'Foo' & 'Bar' over and over.

The trouble is that as you become more expert at something, you become unaware of the initial stumbling blocks to understand something.  People learn in different ways, but people who teach often want you to learn the way that is 'best', which might not be an immediate solution to the 'thing you want to do', but in the long run would be better.  The trouble here is there is no persistent long run, as we all live busy lives and grab moments here and there to learn bits and pieces from various resources scattered on the internet, and those good solutions to problems are scattered amongst 'bad' solutions and outdated answers that just don't work.

Now I've watched a few conference videos about Elm people who want Elm to be more mainstream & accessible, and I think that the people who wish to learn could help by giving feedback as to what the barriers to learning a language like Elm are.  The documentation that I have read for Elm, has been very clear & well written, it it appears that the Elm creators really want their language to be more accessable.  Here is a very relevant talk which touches on the subject of growing a community - link to article & video here <http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design> 

For me, the biggest issue is finding quality learning resources that WORK with the current version of Elm 0.17.  I think if a language had a manifesto it should include that all training videos, tutorial articles, language documentation etc... have the version of Elm stamped on every page, and every code file has a comment with the Elm version number.  People pick up various fragments of code from many places, and when things don't work due to this problem, even the best resources become a reason to give up or avoid learning further.

###So what is next?
* document my attempt to start learning Elm.
* document my struggle to get Electron & Elm working together.
* create an Elm Electron starter project, with good comments.
* document getting Elm to work with various node_modules.
* give feedback to the Elm guys, that will help them lower the barriers to learning the Elm language.
* write articles for medium.com to encourage others to learn Elm.
* add setup files with instructions to many examples to a Github repository.
* create a Gitter channel that encourages new starters, and takes them on the journey of learning Elm, and  that encourages them to give feedback, create more examples, components, and tutorials that help Elm grow.
* document other areas useful to getting started with Elm such as Homebrew, Npm, Node, and Electron.
* create a different kind of YouTube series, where people learning Elm teach others what they have learned.
