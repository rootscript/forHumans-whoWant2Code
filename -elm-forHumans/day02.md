This is a part 02 of a diary of a new user trying to learn the Elm language.  Part 01 was a draft of an article `-elm-forHumans` for the medium.com series called `forHumans() => {whoWant2Code}`

The main project aim is to help ordinary people who want to create/code their own applications that use web technologies, to create their own native applications & not just 'traditional' web pages.

The second project aim is to encourage people who are learning Elm, to contribute back to the project, and provide them the means & structure to do that.

The Electron framework	is a key part of what I think is a very nice platform for learning, that is current & will produce useable applications.  I've been looking at the other key parts, and believe that Functional Programming & Reactive techniques are the next step in making great useable desktop apps, that leverage all the advances in web technology.

###Useful resources that I've found that will help learn Elm

Ok so this is day 02, and despite not having learnt anything major on day 01, I'm still here and want to plan what and where to find the next steps.   I'd like to create a list of resources as I find them, and give my first honest impressions as to whether I think they will be useful.






Here is a very relevant talk which touches on the subject of growing a community - link to article & video here <http://www.elmbark.com/2016/03/16/mainstream-elm-user-focused-design> 

For me, the biggest issue is finding quality learning resources that WORK with the current version of Elm 0.17.  I think if a language had a manifesto it should include that all training videos, tutorial articles, language documentation etc... have the version of Elm stamped on every page, and every code file has a comment with the Elm version number.  People pick up various fragments of code from many places, and when things don't work due to this problem, even the best resources become a reason to give up or avoid learning further.

###So what is next?
* document my attempt to start learning Elm.
* document my struggle to get Electron & Elm working together.
* create an Elm Electron starter project, with good comments.
* document getting Elm to work with various node_modules.
* give feedback to the Elm guys, that will help them lower the barriers to learning the Elm language.
* write articles for medium.com to encourage others to learn Elm.
* add setup files with instructions to many examples to a Github repository.
* create a Gitter channel that encourages new starters, and takes them on the journey of learning Elm, and  that encourages them to give feedback, create more examples, components, and tutorials that help Elm grow.
* document other areas useful to getting started with Elm such as Homebrew, Npm, Node, and Electron.
* create a different kind of YouTube series, where people learning Elm teach others what they have learned.
