*This is a part 05 of a diary of a new user trying to learn the Elm language.  Part 01 was a draft of an article `-elm-forHumans` for the medium.com series called `forHumans() => {whoWant2Code}`*

*The main project aim is to help ordinary people who want to create/code their own applications that use web technologies, to create their own OS native applications & not just 'traditional' web pages trapped in a a current version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox; but able to access local files, interact with the system OS, etc... with fewer browser based restrictions.*

*The second aim of the project is to encourage people who are learning Elm, to contribute back to the project, and provide them the means & structure to do that.  One thing that usually is hard to discover, is how to setup your code editor of choice to syntax highlight, code complete, display documents etc... and specifically with Elm, to use elm-format, elm-make, elm-reactor.  Finally how to get the latest docset for the Elm language and be able to view them locally & offline.*

*I started trying to get Webstorm setup, but got sidetracked on the idea that if I also collated everything I could for Atom, LightTable, and Visual Studio Code, it would be a nice single place to come to get your environment setup, but also a nice place to come and contribute any further tips.*

We can all do things in JS & Node, and we would like to do them in Elm with all the protection that the language offers, but we don't want to lose all the functionality of whatever we can do in JS & node.  For those who know how to code in Elm, moving JS applications to Elm is just a matter of writing the code in Elm.  For those learning Elm, it is a battle between trying to learn a new language which seems to only expose certain parts which are mature enough to be documented; which we believe to be a limited set of documented things, and trying to convince or ask for help from Elm people in the know.  So now on my 5th day, what do I really think about Elm and learning it?  The following is a mostly unedited version, that comes straight out, exactly as I feel it, it is typed.

###So what do I think after 5 days of Elm ( honestly )

Well Elm is an ongoing project that appears to be in the hands on one person, with some other key people that inject some very diplomat `solutions` that try to balance between Elm's strict focus & direction & the practical implementation of using a language that is evolving, and a user base that has needs/wants to achieve things now.

In my opinion, it really does help to have a single overview of a project, a global view that takes everything into account using judgement as to which parts are core ( vital to the projects integrity ), and which parts are fringe ( things that are nice to have, but as yet are not mature enough, or as yet have not been developed or explored fully ( or things that have not been considered yet, which might be very useful or allow a future direction ) ).  My view as a new starter, is that I want / need to know what is `core` & what is `fringe`, and when will all of these parts be worked on, and when can I use them.   This is something that I have found hard to find, some kind of overview as to where we were ( what has been added / removed ), and where we are going, a historical roadmap.

After 5 days with Elm, I am in at least 2 minds about what to do with it.

- documentation IS a problem in Elm.  Because it is a new language, people try to document their successes, so that others can benefit.  Many articles are out of date, and documentation focusses on what you can do, but ignores what a JS transitioner might expect, stuff that you can't do & temporary work arounds that are not ideal. It lacks things that will help get you up and running under the premise that 'this isn't the correct Elm way of doing things, but it will get your code working, and we are looking at ways to make this easier & implement it into the language'.  Maybe the documentation could link to future proposals, to at best allow people to contribute & comment, and at worst alleviate the unknown by just confirming that it is a detail that is going to be worked on further, and it has a single place to go to get more information on it's progress, or if there is no progress at least a place comment & put constructive arguments as to why you think something is important or useful.
- I wish that there was some kind of documentation manager, which indicated `levels` of accuracy & confidence.  By that last sentence I mean that we are a community, all with different perspectives & proficiency in the Elm language, and we all publish guides, articles, and documentation to different places scattered on the internet, and that it would very nice to be able to register any documentation for approval or improvement to those higher up the Elm list of people who can check for problems or enhance solutions by making them easier to understand, injecting their knowledge to the current contemporary topics being published.  This would be very useful, as it would be one place to go that collated everything, and could be trusted to be available to be improved & seen by those able to contribute, and finally that it could be steered by anyone who had a voice & was willing to publish an article or document.
- I wish I could find a non trivial example, that went through the code line by line, explaining every character, so that any English speaking alien who happened to land on Earth could understand, a documented example that explains everything clearly and concisely, and that assumes no prior knowledge, and doesn't defer explaining things to another document.
- Still on the subject of documentation, is there really no working search function with search word highlighting on <http://elm-lang.org/docs>, that really is not helpful, and you cannot do a boolean search `subscription -effects +time` produces no results.  Elm is not listed on <http://devdocs.io/>, and you will be very hard pushed to find Elm docs for Dash ( It took me a whole evening to generate Elm docs for Dash ).  This point really frustrates me, as the docs should be automatically generated to as many formats needed.
- Out of date repos, youtube videos, articles etc... for older versions of Elm, please mark these as outdated ( ask the community to update their work, please ), or at the very least mark them with the version of Elm that works with.  I've even looked at material from Elm contributors which is out of date.  All of the out of date materials are like booby traps that waste our time, it really makes the whole learning Elm an experience that is sometimes unpleasant and messy.

###What do I like?
- The people are friendly, the language wants to be strict, and I like the fact that Elm as a language can change significantly between version releases if it is deemed for the greater good.  The frustrating part is the change procedure does't seem to be organised or discussed in the wider community, maybe its different within the inner circles, but as part of the community I feel left out, secondary.  It feels like things will change and 'we' are happy with the changes, here is one article that tells you about it.  For example, goodbye FRP, you don't need to know the details, it is too complicated, do worry that you have invested anytime in FRP, this is the new way.  If there is a new way, please explain in detail, why it is better, and get me up to speed on understanding the new concepts, and please don't be afraid to draw some diagrams, rather than paragraphs of text.  People absorb and understand different types of diagrams & presentations of data, having more than one type helps to reinforce ideas. Circle bits of code, underline the important parts, draw arrows, these are everyday tools that we all use to explain things, but for some reason we are just meant to look at code from an language someone else invented and understand it using only words and a very minimal set of comments like --MODEL --UPDATE --VIEW, is that really all we get.
- this section was meant to be about the parts I Like, but I guess that the bad parts just muddy the water & obscure the good.  Maybe I will continue in a few days, getting out all the bad parts of the learning Elm environment, before I can concentrate on the good bits. :o)
- Well I guess that we all understand that it is an evolving language, and with each change there will always be a subsequent period of turmoil; it would be interesting to read up on how other fastly involving languages have deal or not dealt with those circumstances.

###What can I suggest that might help?
- Build an Elm language documentation site that allow users to circle / underline parts of code examples or the explanatory text, and be able to added inline comments explaining the parts they don't understand.
- Have a list ( like awesome-lists ) where the community can link to articles / tutorials scattered on the internet, that are out of date.  Then message the authors, kindly requesting them to update or at least clearly mark the version of Elm used is not current.
- Get more new to Elm & new to programming people to proof read the documentation & examples.
- Encourage people to create snippets that are well titled, rather than just chat wishing messages that will get lost in Slack over time.  There must be a way to save all the valuable bits of information from all the helpful members of the community.   Also the frequency of questions in the Slack channels are a good indication of where the documentation ( or the awareness of the relevant documentation, or the ability to find that information ) is lacking.
- Greatly improve the search function on the Elm documentation website.
- Get the docs published to different formats, like community contributed Dash docsets.
- Youtube video series on how to build up applications in Elm, rather than just conference videos.  Daily drip is a good example, one 5 mins video a day ( obviously stating which version of Elm is being used in every video ).
- Have the Elm version in every code example as a comment.
- Ask the community what types of applications that they would like to build in Elm.
- Encourage & facilitate users to screen share, hangout, have live coding sessions, we really aren't advancing the user base by just using written words.  Can you imaging a modern classroom where pupils didn't talk and were only allowed to read from books.
